In this folder is a game made with my groupmates for a project for year 1.1 module Computational Design Thinking

This game is a multiplayer text based game. When the game starts, the first player will choose a
prefix for the game. Each player is allocated 20 seconds as their health, each turn will deduct
their health based on the time spent on their turn.

Players will use the chosen prefix to type the word, the game will record the time spent on their
turn and deduct their health before proceeding to the next playerâ€™s turn.

When players enter an invalid word (i.e. wrong spelling, repetition), the game will prompt him to
try again. The player loses if he runs out of time, the game will continue until there is 1 player
remaining.
